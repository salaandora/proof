# proof
When ran, this file provides the answer to 2+2, thus proving it's 4
Based on a proof using set theory, from Giovanni Rikard Åbrink on Quora

"Let A, B be two sets with two elements each; without loss of generality suppose  A={1,2} ,  B={3,4} . For every set S, let  |S|  denote the cardinality of set S. Then  |A|=2=|B| . Also, since by construction of A and B  A∩B=∅ ,  |A∩B|=4  (this is true by inspection:  A∩B={1,2,3,4} , just notice that we can count set elements without defining addition, so we can independently show that the cardinality of  A∩B  is indeed 4). Thus, by definition of addition of integers “a+b” as the cardinality of the union of disjunct sets of individual cardinality a and b, we have  2+2=4 , QED."
